My love with computer started when I entered in college. So let me tell you a short story how I started on web development.

Honestly speaking, I don't know much about computers when I was in grade school. Maybe because I don't have one in our home. Anyway, I don't have that much interest on computers at that time. What I want on computers are just games, games, and games.

How I came up to be a web developer? I graduated high school with a plan of being an architect after college. But it doesn't happen. Since I realized that technology is rapidly growing, I thought of enrolling Computer Engineering course instead of Architecture. Enrollment comes, I suddenly enrolled as an Information Technology student. It's weird, right?

Moving on. I was in first year college when I first experienced computer programming. C++ is my very first programming language that I've used. It was really amazing that I can tell the computer what to do. What I remember on C++ are these: `cin` and `cout`. It was also in my first year in college when I first wrote HTML. I was really really amazed when we had our HTML class because I don't know that you can even build a website by just using notepad on your machine. It was funny to remember that we always use frames and tables for layouts, bold, italic, and marquee tags. It was also my first time to encounter algorithm, flowchart, sorting, etc.

Second year college when I experienced programming on .Net framework. Specifically VB.Net. I had a spark on my eyes when I knew that VB.Net has a feature where you can make GUI (Graphical User Interface) by just dragging and dropping them in your workspace. Unlike on C++ which is a console based programming language. SQL is also introduced on the same year. We generated tables and fields for the database. And we also tried making a query for the database. I really had fun on our Database Management class. From then on, we built small programs where we need to connect the application to the database.

Third year college is where I encountered PHP and CSS. It was pretty dang cool to make your website more stylish, powerful, and dynamic. I had a spark on my eyes when I met PHP. Some PHP and JavaScript frameworks were also introduced which helps you to build easier and faster. Some of these are [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) and [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) for the PHP frameworks. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) for the JavaScript frameworks. From then on, I said to myself that I want to be a Web Developer someday.

Fourth year came. So we have to take up On-the-Job Trainings and making our thesis. On our on-the-job training, we were tasked to develop web based application called BPLS (Business Permits and Licensing System). To give you an overview about BPLS, it is a system which processes the application of business permits and it also computes and collects business taxes of a specific business establishment.

After college, I continued learning about Web Development. I read blogs about it. I continued developing small projects that can make my skill grow. Now, I am a professional web developer. I work for a company now. But my learning won't stop here. I can say that I still need to learn more since the web is rapidly growing. 

So, that's how I became a web developer. I know that my skill is not enough. What's important is, there should be a growth on your skill. Try to learn new stuff everyday. Cheerio!
