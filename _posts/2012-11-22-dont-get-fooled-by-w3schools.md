I remember that I always consult W3Schools when I have to know about HTML or Javascript. I’ve used W3Schools as my reference for a long time. Well I’ve been on a wrong place for how many years.

Recently, I saw W3Fools. W3Fools is a website made by the members of the Front-end Dev Community. It has a content where it shows that W3Schools is not a reliable resource when it comes to HTML and Javascript.

Now, you’re maybe wondering why W3Schools is a troublesome resource. Well, W3Schools is not affiliated with W3C.(World Wide Web Consortium). W3C is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. And the worst reason why W3Schools is they frequently publishes inaccurate content.

To show you some of the inaccurate content published by W3Schools, here are some list of the misleading content written by the people from W3Fools:

* W3Schools: The latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera support some HTML5 features. Internet Explorer 9 will support some HTML5 features.

* W3Fools: This is misleading. Many features that have existed for years in IE are just now being standardized by HTML5, e.g. `contenteditable`. IE8 also already supports `localStorage`, which is an HTML5 feature.

* W3Fools: Professional web developers do not recommend the use of WYSIWYG editors.
